      Origin of the force:
     </p>

     <p class="matter">
          Efforts towards crime control on the Railways are almost as old as history of the Indian Railways itself.  Soon after the introduction of Railways in India in 1853, the Private Railway companies, which owned the railway system, then found that they were besieged with thefts of materials and tools from the Workshops and Stores. On order to save their interests, the private Railway companies initially deployed their own private police force.  This formed the earliest instance of formation of a private security system on the Railways.

     <p class="matter">
          However, with the enactment of Indian Police Act in 1861, all private police were banned, Mean while on the recommendation of the Railway Police Committee 1872 the Railway Police was organized in to Government Police for law enforcement and Company Police for the Watch and Ward duties for the Railways.  The actual implementations of these came about in 1881.

          RPF in the post-Independence Era:

     </p>
     <p class="matter">
          The post Independence era saw large scale changes in the Railway System.  The erstwhile princely states had their own small railway lines to cater to their internal requirements mostly for trains running on meter gauge or narrow gauge systems.  The partition of the country brought its own set of problems and train operations became more complex.  New lines were laid and conversion of important Meter Gauges to Broad Gauges were also taken up.   The Railways were nationalized and re-organized into nine Zonal Railways. The overall pattern of train operations underwent large scale changes which brought in its wake, new challenges and new problem areas.

     <p class="matter">
          Acknowledging the need for a better system of security and policing on Railways, the Government of India set up various study committees to bring out suitable changes in their systems of security on the Railways.  Notable among these are:
     </p>
     <p class="matter">
          The High powered Committee on Security and Policing of the Railways, 1966-68 and the One-man expert Committee on Railway Security and Protection 1976.

          RPF: Future perspective:
     </p>
     <p class="matter">
          The recent amendments in 2003, in the Railways Act 1989, and the RPF Act 1957 have conferred additional powers on the RPF to tackle petty offenders in railways and towards maintenance of orderliness in railway premises.  This however, is not to state that an ideal situation has been achieved in solving the security related problems in Railways.  There still remain certain vital areas that have to be covered in the fight against crimes and lawlessness on Railways.  Security of rail passengers and prompt registration of baggage thefts on the trains have been the biggest areas wanting in this regard.  For this purpose, legislation on the lines of the Railway Offences, 1976 is extremely necessary, which can confer the RPF with additional powers to tackle certain cognizable offences, and specifically property offences in the railway premises under Indian Penal Code.

          About the Organization

     </p>
     <p class="matter">
          South Central Railway was formed on 2nd October, 1966 as the 9th zone of the Indian Railways. In its forty two years of committed service and path breaking progress, South Central Railway has grown to a modern system of mass transportation fulfilling the aspirations of the passengers/customers and carved a niche for itself in Indian Railways system. On formation of the South Central Railway Vijayawada Division is a part of it. The Vijayawada Division forms a vital link in the network of Indian Railways; it is the threshold to South India and connects East, South, West and North".

          The Railway Protection Force has its origin since 1882 when the Railway Companies then in existence appointed their own security for each Department.  This arrangement   was   found   to be fairly satisfactory till 1918. With an increase in traffic; there was a steep rise in the incidence of thefts of goods entrusted to Railways. This led to the Government of India to appoint a committee to enquire into causes thereof and suggest corrective measures. 
          Acting on the Committeeâ€™s recommendations, most of the Class I Railways reorganized their security as a separate unit under a superior officer.  But this too proved inadequate, and in the aftermath of the Second World War, losses due to thefts and claims on the Railways assumed huge size and needed serious attention.

     </p>
     <p class="matter">
          The  Government  of  India,  therefore in year 1954,  instituted  a  special  enquiry  through  Director, Intelligence Bureau (Ministry of Home Affairs) who in his report,  forcefully brought out  the  necessity  of  organizing  the  security in railways  on  a statutory basis.  The Railway Board  also  appointed  a  Security  Adviser  to the Railway Board in July, 1953 to work out the  details  for  the  reorganization  of  the  Security department.  It was decided in consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  that  there  should be an integrated well organized force on the model of the Police with adequate supervisory staff specially trained to  meet  the  peculiar  aspects of crime that were  prevalent  in  Railways  and  act  as  a  second  line  to  the  States  Police  with  whom,  under  the Constitution,  policing  on  Railways was rested.  This led to introduction of the R.P.F.  Bill in the Parliament of India for the better protection and security of Railway property and the same was passed as The Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 (No.23 of 1957).

     </p>
     <p class="matter">
          Gradually and steadily the force has evolved in many aspects from then onwards and there after The RPF Act, 1957 was modified by Parliament for the first time in 1985 vide Act No.60 for the constitution and maintenance of the Force as an Armed Force of the Union and for the second time  in 2003 with Railway Act vide which the additional responsibilities of Passenger Safety and Security of their belongings were laid on the shoulder of the Force by extending the powers of execution of 29 sections of Railway Act. At present the Force is escorting maximum number of mail/express trains throughout the length and breadth of the nation beside the access control duties at important stations.
